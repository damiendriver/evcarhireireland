EV Car Hire is a user-friendly web application to allow users book electric vehicle rentals. The React frontend invites users to sign up, browse the available fleet and easily filter by dates and locations.  
The platform simplifies the process of booking an eco-friendly ride with an integrated stripe payment facility. The backend of the application is built using Node and Express with data stored in MongoDB. An API from openchargemap provides information on the nearest available charge points for user convenience.
